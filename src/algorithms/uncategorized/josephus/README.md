# Josephus Algorithm

## Description

"The problem is named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian living in the 1st century. According to Josephus's account of the siege of Yodfat, he and his 40 soldiers were trapped in a cave by Roman soldiers. They chose suicide over capture, and settled on a serial method of committing suicide by drawing lots. Josephus states that by luck or possibly by the hand of God, he and another man remained until the end and surrendered to the Romans rather than killing themselves. ...The specific mechanism [may have been] arranging the men in a circle and counting by threes to determine the order of elimination."

**Algorithm Class:** Counting Problem

### Objectives:
- Determine the order of elimation
- Find the last knight standing

### Rules:
1) All knights are standing in a circle (e.g. 8 knights)
2) Start from the first knight (K1)
3) Eliminate the knight standing three spots ahead (e.g. K4)
4) Move ahead to the next living knight (e.g. K5)
5) Repeat steps 3 and 4
6) When reaching the end of the circle, continue from the beginning (e.g. K8 back to K1)
